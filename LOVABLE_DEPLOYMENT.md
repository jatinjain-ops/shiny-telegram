# Lovable Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your data collection form to Lovable successfully.

## âœ… What We've Fixed

1. **Node.js Installation**: Installed Node.js v24.7.0 and npm v11.5.1
2. **Dependencies**: All project dependencies are properly installed
3. **Build Process**: Application builds successfully without errors
4. **Module Type**: Fixed ES module configuration
5. **Deployment Config**: Added Vercel and Netlify configuration files

## ðŸš€ Lovable Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Connect Repository
1. Go to your Lovable dashboard
2. Click "New Project" or "Import Repository"
3. Select your GitHub repository: `jatinjain-ops/shiny-telegram`
4. Choose the `main` branch

### Step 2: Configure Build Settings
Lovable should automatically detect this as a Vite project. If not, use these settings:

- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
- **Node Version**: `18` or `20`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`

### Step 3: Environment Variables (Optional for Testing)
For testing without Airtable, you can deploy without environment variables. The form will show an error message but the UI will work.

For full functionality, add these environment variables in Lovable:
```
VITE_AIRTABLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your_base_id_here
VITE_AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME=Contacts
```

### Step 4: Deploy
1. Click "Deploy" or "Build"
2. Wait for the build process to complete
3. Your application should be available at the provided URL

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If Lovable Still Can't See the App:

1. **Check Build Logs**: Look for any error messages in the build process
2. **Verify Repository**: Make sure you're connecting to the correct repository
3. **Branch Selection**: Ensure you're using the `main` branch
4. **Node Version**: Try setting Node version to 18 or 20 explicitly

### Common Issues:

1. **"Build failed"**: Check if all dependencies are installed
2. **"Cannot find module"**: Ensure package.json is in the root directory
3. **"Port already in use"**: This shouldn't affect deployment

### Manual Verification:

You can verify the build works locally:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

The build should complete successfully and create a `dist` folder.

## ðŸ“± What You Should See

Once deployed successfully, you should see:
- A beautiful, responsive form
- Fields for Name, Email, and Phone Number
- Real-time validation
- Submit button with loading states
- Success/error messages

## ðŸ”— Next Steps

1. **Test the Form**: Try submitting test data
2. **Set up Airtable**: Configure your Airtable base for data storage
3. **Customize**: Modify the form fields or styling as needed

## ðŸ“ž Support

If you're still having issues:
1. Check the build logs in Lovable
2. Verify the repository URL is correct
3. Ensure all files are pushed to GitHub
4. Contact Lovable support with the build logs
